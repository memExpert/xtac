# Execution time API C

XTAC (Execution Time API C) is a simple multithread API that provide functions for use data structures (like linked list, doubly linked list, b-tree, dynamic array, hashmap and etc.) in C. No generics. No undefined behavior. No memory leaks.

The project was conceived as an educational one and is only at the very beginning of its journey. I will be very glad to constructive criticism, any help and advice. Thank you in advance for your interest in the project.

## What i used:

* [Unity](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file) for unit tests;
* [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) for memory leaks detection;
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for automatic build, pack and test run.
